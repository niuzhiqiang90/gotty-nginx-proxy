# gotty-nginx-proxy


## Introduction
[gotty-nginx-proxy](https://github.com/niuzhiqiang90/gotty-nginx-proxy.git) is the nginx configuration file for reverse proxy the GoTTY.


## Background
Sometimes we can only bind it to a private address, so we need to access it via the nginx reverse proxy.


## Usage
include the `gotty-nginx.conf` in the nginx configure file.
